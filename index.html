            <p id="intro">My name is <strong>Hunter Spadafora</strong>, I'm turning 25 this summer 2022, my pronouns are he/him/his, I have <abbr title="Now refered to as high-functioning autism">Asperger's Syndrome</abbr> and <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, and I'm hoping to graduate in Fall 2022.</p>

                <h2>Taking COMP.4610 - GUI Programming I</h2>
                <h3>Why am I taking COMP.4610 - GUI Programming I this summer 2022?</h3>
                <p>
                    I am taking COMP.4610 - GUI Programming I this summer 2022 for two reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I've learned that my Asperger's Syndrome makes me a very visual/spacial person.  I already knew I was a visual/spacial person, but knowing this pushed me to further learn to interact through visual/spacial media.  I see GUI as one of the top ways to communicate information, especially since I have ADHD which gives me a lower attention span.  <em>This can be seen in how I'm trying to keep the text narrow to make it easier to read.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic forced me to stay at home which is not the best environment for me to be productive.  I took virtual courses and failed most of them since I struggled to do anything course related outside of class.  This messed with my remaining courses needed to graduate, pushed back my graduation, and ended up wasting a lot of money.  By taking GUI I and GUI II over the summer, I can graduate a semester sooner instead of needing just one more semester just to take a single course.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>What I hope to learn</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope to learn about proper GUI techniques and vocabulary.  Not only would this give me a better idea of what looks good visual/spacially, but also the words needed to properly express myself and understand others.
                </p>
                <h3>What I hope to accomplish</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope to be able to create something I can both look at with pride and use in a portfolio.  <em>This webpage alone already feels great to make.</em>
                </p>

                <h2>Why am I taking computer science as my major?</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was younger I loved science (at least to the best an elementary schooler can understand what "science" even means).  I started to beleive my favorite of the sciences was chemistry during my middle school years.  I went to a vocation high school, <a href="https://www.minuteman.org" target="_blank">Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical High School</a>, where I pursued the biotech vocation since it was the closest to chemistry.  All the chemicals, fluids, and cleanliness made me uncomfortable.  My first year in college was <abbr title="Basically a major with no required courses.  All I needed were credits from electives">liberal studies</abbr>; I had no idea what to do for the future.  My dad, a software engineer, convinced me to take an intro to computer science course for a semester.  I enjoyed learning and applying what I learned, so much so that I decided to make it my major.  There are still times where I question my path in life, but this is how I started my computer science major.
                </p>

                <h3>What do I enjoy about computer science?</h3>
                <p>
                    When I can get my act together and work, I keep working and I work hard.  I enjoy the learning process and I especially enjoy using what I just learned.  Imagining the possible answers to the questions, <em>"what can I use this for?" or "what are the possibilities?"</em>, is what makes me the most excited.
                </p>
